This is my Weather Tracker app for "Tech Assesssment 1". The user must enter a specefic city or location and my webapp, using its Weather API KEY from "OpenWeather" will detect the location and show you the Current weather within that place. The "Get 5-day forecase" button shows you the next 5 days of the place you had entered and the weather for each of those days. It shows the weather along with photos made to represent how each weather looks. This coding project took me around 13 hours to make along with help from my friend who just taught me a small lesson with Java. I did all of this coding and hope to be able to do more for this company if i can get this internship.
